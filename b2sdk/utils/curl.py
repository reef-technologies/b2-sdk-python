"""
CURL flow:

A single Curl object handles a single request.
These requests can be added to CurlMulti and polled together.

The idea is:
- Have a single CurlMulti object for all requests.
- Each new Curl is added to it (even across threads).
- Each is streaming data to StreamedBuffer.
- Whenever any of these try to iterate content,
  we just check whether there's more data for any of them.
- If they finished (messages from CurlMulti say so), we're leaving a flag.
